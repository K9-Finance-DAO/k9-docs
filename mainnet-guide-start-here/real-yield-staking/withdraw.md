# Withdraw

**Withdraw/Unstake KNINE**

Unstaking of a KNINE deposit depends on if locked staking or regular staking is used.&#x20;

* For locked staking, only after the locking period has ended will your KNINE be available to withdraw. When it ends, the form will display the “Withdraw” button: If you did not choose locked staking you can unstake your KNINE at any time from Real Yield Staking.\
