#### **Step 2 - Visit the K9 Liquid Staking dApp**

1. Visit [https://app.k9finance.com](https://app.k9finance.com)
2. Connect your wallet
3. It may be beneficial to have the following assets in your wallet to make the best use of the K9 product.&#x20;
   * ERC-20 BONE
   * Shibarium KNINE (visit our [How to Bridge](https://www.k9finance.com/how-to-bridge-knine) guide if you only have KNINE on the Ethereum network)
   * ERC-20 ETH (gas fees)
   * Shibarium BONE (if you only have ERC-20 BONE we recommend bridging at least 1 BONE for gas fees on the [official Shibarium website](https://shibarium.shib.io/bridge))
   * **TIP -** If you are currently staking BONE on a Shib Validator, you will need to re-stake that BONE with the K9 Finance Liquid Staking dApp. To do this, you can undelegate your position on the Shibarium website and redelegate using the K9 Liquid Staking dApp.

**Step 3 - You can now use the K9 Finance interface. Detailed guides for each aspect of the product can be found at the links below:**&#x20;
