# Protocol Fee and Rewards

Validation rewards that K9 Finance DAO receives are split into five parts:

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**0%\***</mark> of all the rewards gets re-delegated (re-staked) on the K9 Finance DAO validators.

{% hint style="info" %}
- Importantly, re-delegation happens **without issuing new knBONE tokens**. Instead, these BONE tokens are delegated to the validators directly along with users' deposits.
- The re-delegation mechanism plays a critical role in boosting the value of knBONE. By continuously accumulating and re-staking a portion of the rewards, the total amount of staked BONE in the system constantly increases.
- In essence, the knBONE system automatically reinvests a part of the rewards back into itself, amplifying returns for users without altering the total knBONE token supply. This helps maintain token value stability while offering users a lucrative staking experience.

* Remaining <mark style="color:yellow;">**100%\***</mark> gets split into 4 parts:
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">**5%**</mark> goes to the DAO Treasury to cover the protocol costs
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">**0%**</mark> gets split up across all other validators as a reward
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">**95%**</mark> goes to the Real Yield Staking rewards pool
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">**0%**</mark> goes to the Liquid Staking Instant reward pool

All fees are distributed in the form of BONE. The fee percentages are set by the K9 Finance DAO Governance and stored on-chain.\
\
\*Protocol fee splits will be decided on by the management council and can be voted on by the DAO. The most recent proposal for fees & rewards can be found in the [K9 Finance Governance Forum](https://forum.k9finance.com/t/k9-product-fees-reward-distribution-structure/336).
