Here you will see your bonus rewards.

The process is simple. To get this reward, you only need to have an active deposit in such a farming pool (stake or zap). Or you can make a deposit while this reward pool is active.

The rewards are claimable anytime. You will get these bonus rewards once you unstake/unzap or claim you accumulated rewards (see Unstake, Unzap and Claim All).
