* **Stake KNINE:** Deposit your KNINE tokens to participate in Real Yield Staking. You can choose between two options:
  * **Staking without Lockup:** Offers flexibility to withdraw your KNINE tokens anytime but comes with a base multiplier (x1) for reward calculation.
  * **Locked Staking:** Lock your KNINE tokens for a chosen period (1-12 months) to benefit from a higher multiplier (up to maxLockMultiplier) on your rewards. The longer the lockup period, the greater the multiplier.&#x20;
