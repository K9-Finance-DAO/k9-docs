# Overview
K9 Finance is a DAO governed liquid staking protocol for the Shibarium blockchain. The product allows users to stake their ERC20 BONE tokens on Ethereum mainnet and immediately get the representation of their share in the form of knBONE liquid staking tokens on Shibarium without maintaining their own staking infrastructure. Users will get staking rewards and still be able to retain custody of their knBONE tokens. BONE tokens will be delegated across validators that are registered and accepted by the DAO inside the K9 Finance liquid staking protocol.

* Node operators don't have direct access over the delegated assets.
* They are just providing infrastructure and getting rewards in return.
* Assets are controlled by K9 Finance DAO decentralized smart contracts exclusively.

The goal is to support Shibarium decentralization and integrate knBONE with the variety of protocols and DeFi applications on Ethereum and Shibarium.

The K9 Finance DAO unlocks a wider DeFi ecosystem by providing staking, farming, and vesting functionalities built around the liquid staking protocol.

### The K9 Finance DAO[​](https://docs.polygon.lido.fi/#the-lido-dao) <a href="#the-lido-dao" id="the-lido-dao"></a>

The [K9 Finance DAO](https://snapshot.org/#/k9safe.eth) is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that manages the liquid staking protocol by deciding on key parameters (e.g., setting fees, assigning node operators, etc.) through the voting power of governance token ($KNINE) holders. Also, the DAO will accumulate service fees that are managed by the DAO.

### KNINE Token[​](https://docs.polygon.lido.fi/#ldo-token) <a href="#ldo-token" id="ldo-token"></a>

$KNINE is the ecosystem governance token granting governance rights in the K9 Finance DAO. By holding the KNINE token, one is granted voting rights within the DAO. In K9 Finance DAO, each $KNINE token permits one vote. The $KNINE token can also be staked to receive governance fee rewards.
