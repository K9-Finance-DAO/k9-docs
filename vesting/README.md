# Vesting

The Vesting functionality within our project empowers you to strategically unlock the value of your esKNINE tokens over a predetermined period. This feature allows you to lock your esKNINE tokens in exchange for KNINE tokens, distributed linearly throughout the chosen vesting period.

**Here's how Vesting benefits you:**

* **Controlled Release:** Gain peace of mind by gradually releasing your reward KNINE by burning esKNINE, potentially aligning with your reward goals.
* **Increased Earning Potential:** While your esKNINE tokens are vested, you receive the KNINE during the vesting period and BONE rewards from Real Yield Staking.
* **Flexibility with Staking:** Vesting also supports the non-locked staking deposits (optional), which means that you can increase or decrease your vesting limit anytime.

Vesting rules are:

1. **Basic rule for participation** - user must have KNINE tokens locked for at least 6 months at Real Yield Staking.
2. Optional - non-locked staking positions may be accepted to increase the vesting limit.
3. Vesting limit is calculated according to the backing ratio. So, you can vest your esKNINE tokens up to the vesting limit.
4. Vesting period - 180 days, during which the KNINE tokens will be released linearly.
5. esKNINE is converted into KNINE according to the vesting ratio.
6. You can increase your vested amount by adding more esKNINE if the **basic rule** is completed.
